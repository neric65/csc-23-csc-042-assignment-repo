Create a PHP web application for registering students.
Requirements
• A form with fields:
o Full Name
o Email
o Department
o Matric Number
• A PHP script (process.php) that:
o Validates inputs (all fields required, email must be valid).
o Saves the data into a MySQL database (student_records table).
• A view.php page that displays all registered students in a table.



This is a simple PHP web application for registering students. It allows users to input student details and stores them in a MySQL database. The application also provides functionality to view all registered students and delete records as needed.

## Project Structure

```
student-registration-app
│   ├── config
│   │   └── db.php          # Database connection settings
│   ├── process.php         # Handles form submission and data validation
│   ├── view.php            # Displays all registered students
│   ├── delete.php          # Processes deletion of student records
│   └── index.php           # Landing page with registration form
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd student-registration-app
   ```

2. **Create a MySQL database**:
   Create a database named `student_registration` and a table named `student_records` with the following structure:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE student_records (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       full_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       department VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       matric_number VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
   );
   ```

3. **Configure the database connection**:
   Edit the `db.php` file to include your database credentials:
   ```php
   <?php
   $host = 'localhost';
   $db   = 'student_registration';
   $user = 'your_username';
   $pass = 'your_password';
   $charset = 'utf8mb4';

   $conn = new mysqli($host, $user, $pass, $dbname);

   if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
   }
   ?>
    ```

4. **Run the application**:
   Open `index.php` in your web browser to access the registration form. Fill in the details and submit to register a student.

## Additional Information

- Ensure that your server has PHP and MySQL installed.
